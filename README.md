# IocTalk

Sample projects for my Dependency Injection / IOC Container talk.

### Abstract

Being one of the SOLID principles, dependency injection has gained quite a bit of momentum over the years.  By allowing for the testability and loose coupling of code, this pattern has become the cornerstone of many architectural concepts. But what is dependency injection? How do IOC containers help?  How do I choose a container that best suites my application? These are all questions that are important to understand in today's development world.  In this talk we will discuss IOC Containers, what they are, what problem they solve, and how to choose the best one for your next project!
